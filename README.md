# Introduction

Included is code which is designed to test your understanding of coding concepts, and your ability to debug code. Please take some time to read and understand the examples provided.

Instructions for each example are given in the exampleX.py file as well as documented in this file.

If you have any confusion, please state any assumptions you have made and act around those assumptions. The quality of the assumptions may have an impact in our assessment of your code if they strip away the challenge.

## Example 1 - Stack Trace

This example is designed to test a developers ability to debug issues within code. In this example the error and stack trace will be outputted in the console.

### Definition of Done

For each of the scenarios in `examples.example1.py`, document the following:
- State if the scenario works or does not work
- If the scenario does not work, please determine the reason why.

## Example 2 - Performance

This example is designed to test a developers ability to improve code and spot issues
with poor performing code.

In this example we have a class which is attempting to maintain a deduplicated collection of information. It does so quite imperfectly. In this task we ask you to improve the add  method by implementing your own add2 method.

The result will be assessed for accuracy and speed.

### Definition of Done

You have generated a solution which runs faster than the original method and it does so accurately.

## Example 3 - Inheritance

This example is designed to test your ability to extend an existing class.

In this example we have a partially implemented class Employee which extends off a simple Person object.

We want the employeee object to behave as expected.

Different values may be used, so do not hard code a response.

### Definition of Done

You have generated a solution which acts in an expected manner. Where there is uncertainty, please state any assumptions in code.

## Example 4 - Validation

This example is designed to test your ability to validate data. In this example we have a blank validation method.

You have a person object which refers to a representation of a persons bank account. You need to add validations which prevent illegal/unexpected operations from occuring.

You do not need to be exhaustive, but should use your own judgement how much validation is required.

### Definition of Done

- Prevent negative withdrawals.
- Prevent overdraft withdrawals
- State what you think are reasonable testing parameters (boundary cases)

## Example 5 - Abstract

This example is designed to expose you to poorly written and documented code. You will need to debug this code to determine what is happening.

A testing example has been given which covers how we might expect this to be run.

Then please re-write the class, and its methods with names.

### Definition of Done

- ReWrite a readable version of the class
- Include docstrings
- State a use for this class

## BONUS POINTS
Please include any typos, code errors, or logic errors you might find.
